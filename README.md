## Content Builder
Shopify removed my post on the forum because they know they *** up with the custom sections they promised to deliver by the end of 2019 year. This is why I implementing this app - for free. It will be ready at **December 20th, 2019 or earlier**.

Content Builder is coming soon! **Custom sections everywhere, custom fields everywhere.**

For example - you just open product page in the app and you can edit content like Wordpress ACF, Statamic or Craft. 
It uses fieldsets - which are schema on steroids, because you don't have to code them now - drag and drop them! 
You want to use product fieldset on this one article you need - no problem. Fieldset for the collections on one of the pages - who cares, NO PROBLEM! 

Every item in the store, product, collection, page, article, blog, customer, order, even store - can use every fieldset-schema you create! Sections available everywhere without hacks and tricks - content is saved in metafields so you have access to it from every part of the website!
